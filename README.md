# 💾 TJ OS - My Y2K Portfolio Experience 💿

BACk to the future

## ✨ Blast From The Past! ✨

Remember the good ol' days of dial-up, chunky monitors, and operating systems that felt like a digital adventure? Welcome back! This isn't just a portfolio; it's a **TJ OS**, a fully interactive desktop experience built with React, designed to beam you straight back to the late 90s / early 2000s.

Get ready to double click your way through my skills and projects, all wrapped up in a nostalgic Y2K interface!

## 🚀 Features Currently Installed:

*   **Authentic Boot Sequence:** Watch TJ OS come to life, complete with (simulated) hardware checks and OS loading messages. Can you hear the startup jingle?
*   **Interactive Desktop:**
    *   **Draggable & Resizable Windows:** Just like you remember! Manage multiple "applications" at once.
    *   **Desktop Icons:** Launch portfolio sections and mock applications.
    *   **Taskbar:** Keep track of open windows and access the (placeholder) Start Menu. Includes a retro system tray with a ticking clock!
    *   **Right-Click Context Menus:** For that true OS feel on desktop icons and the desktop itself.
    *   **Customizable Wallpaper & Cursor:** Head to the "Control Panel" (Settings app) to personalize your desktop.
    *   **Screensaver:** Don't touch that mouse! After a period of inactivity, enjoy a classic Starfield screensaver (or choose "None" if you're actively browsing). 3D Pipes coming... eventually?
*   **Built-in "Applications":**
    *   **My Documents (Portfolio Hub):**
        *   **HomeBase:** Get a quick welcome and overview.
        *   **Intel (About):** Learn more about my skills, journey, and (conceptual) Y2K-era education.
        *   **My Creations (Projects):** Browse through a selection of my real-world projects, including my current focus on a **Cow Heat Tracking System**.
        *   **Ping Me! (Contact):** Send a simulated digi-message or find my actual contact details.
        *   **The Resume.doc (CV):** "Download" my CV (text file simulation, of course!).
    *   **Recycle Bin:** With dynamic empty/full icons! You can even (conceptually) restore items.
    *   **Control Panel (Settings):** Change your wallpaper, screensaver, and mouse cursor.
    *   **Calculator:** A functional, Y2K-styled calculator for all your number-crunching needs.
    *   **Notepad:** Jot down some quick notes.
    *   **Minesweeper (Placeholder):** The icon is there, the nostalgia is real. Actual game TBD!
    *   **CD Player (Placeholder):** Insert a disc (simulated) and "play" some tunes!
*   **Y2K Aesthetics:**
    *   Classic "raised" and "sunken" button styles.
    *   Gradient title bars.
    *   Pixel-perfect (almost!) icons.
    *   System fonts that scream "retro".

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Under the Hood (The "Modern" Magic):

Even though it looks retro, TJ OS is powered by some pretty modern tech:

*   **React 19:** For building this dynamic user interface.
*   **TypeScript:** For type safety and a better development experience.
*   **Vite:** For a blazing-fast development server and build process.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** For styling (with custom Y2K classes sprinkled in `index.html`).
*   **Custom Hooks:** `useContextMenu`, `useDraggable`, `useIdleTimer` to manage complex UI interactions.
*   **SVG Icons:** For crisp, scalable retro icons.

## 🔮 Future System Upgrades (Planned Features):

*   Functional Start Menu.
*   More interactive game placeholders (Minesweeper, anyone?).
*   Sound effects for UI interactions (clicks, window open/close).
*   Deeper file system simulation within "My Documents" beyond portfolio sections.
*   More screensaver options!
*   Perhaps a "Clippy" assistant? (Maybe not...)

## 🐛 Known "Bugs" & Quirks (It's Y2K, after all!):

*   Some application functionalities are placeholders (e.g., full game logic, CD playback).
*   The "mock file system" is very basic.
*   Advanced window management features (cascading, tiling) are not implemented. It's all about that free-form Y2K window chaos!
*   Performance might chug a bit if you open *too many* windows, just like the old days!
